         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

tranſgreſſe the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Almighty, wherby they purchaced to
themſelues, and to all their poſteritie eternall damnation. He continually
putteth his cunning and Stratagemes in vſe againſt ſeely poore man:
Sometime by open bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, as cauſing him to commit mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, adulterie,
theft, extortion, and ſuch like groſſe offences, againſt the
commaundementes of the ſeconde Table. Another time, he ſolliciteth him to
pride, Idolatry, blaſpheming, vnbeliefe, lothing the word of God, contempte
of the ſame, rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte God, vnthankefulneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, and
ſuch like, againſt the commandements of the firſt Table: whereby he
deliuereth vnto vs ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and dangerous aſſaultes, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he
dreſſeth agaynſt vs ſurprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as when by meane of the ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed

enſue. But indede the Eternall, which hath created the heart, ſeeth all
theſe things in vs, and abhorreth and condemneth them, he is the ſearcher
of the raines, which knoweth the thought before it bee hatched in vs.
Wherefore, we haue great cauſe, to beg of God, his grace, that we may
vnderſtand and know the ruzes and deceiptes of Sathan, whereby to auoyde
them, and when he ſhal at any time ſollicite vs to any of the aboue named
things, or ſuche like, let vs then know that the enimy is at hand, that he

<pb facs="tcp:2340:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>his ambuſhes to cut betweene vs, and our ſaluation:
wherefore, it behoueth vs to bee alwayes armed with the armour of God, whereof
Sainct Paule ſpeaketh in the Epiſtle to the Epheſians, 6. Chapter, and to
bee well acquaynted with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vſe of our weapon: for oure eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie is

<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13.14.</note> yea, into the

it ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither to caſt vs downe with the weight of our ſinnes,
into deſperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo to damne vs: for he wyll alleadge vnto vs the
iuſtice of God, the horrour of oure ſinnes, and the Law, cleane contrarie
to Chriſte, for Chriſte is the nouriture, medicine, <pb facs="tcp:2340:4"/>and
conſolation of afflicted ſoules, he will not breake the bruzed reede, nor
quench the ſmoking tow, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt beware of this falſe and

in the which we ſhall finde all comforte: and hauing founde it we muſt lay
ſure holde on it in all humilitie and Prayer, the whiche word doth euen
repulſe and chaſe Sathan from vs. It is a lighte whiche lighteneth to our

Saincte Paule calleth it the Sword of the Spirit, the which wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and
putteth Sathan to flighte: it is that Sword, without the whiche we may not
fight the battayle wyth that ſtrong and mightie enimie, with whome wee muſt
euerye one of vs fight a battayle, eyther in the time of oure healthe, or
elſe in the article of our death, for then beginneth he to play ſharply the

to the ende he maye make vs to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God through vnbeleefe, and ſo to

<note place="margin">Hebr. <hi>1.10.</hi> &amp; <hi>14.</hi>

thou canſt in no wiſe hurt me, if he can not in this ſort preuaile. Then
commeth he in another lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; with his faire face, with flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and

in peace and quietneſſe: but to ſhew you the better to vnderſtand howe
to giue order, and to diſpoſe of your houſe: it is that you giue vnto
euery man that whiche is his due, withoute deceyuing any man: that you leaue
